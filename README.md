# Modelling-Powder-Flow
This repository is to store some of the code I have been attempting in my research project. The intention is to create a model that can predict the physical parameters of a powder from bulk flow measurements. As this problem is non-trivial and also can be classed as a MOOP, some form of ML is required to find optimal solutions. Multiple different methods have been attempted, firstly by trying to reverse the problem and work out the bulk flow parameters from the physical ones (which were inputted into a DEM simulation), with the intention to see if there were any lessons that could be learnt from this. Then a first attempt has been made to use an evolutionary algorithm to work out the Pareto front of the physical parameters. The inital data was stored in multiple feather files, which made it difficult to deal with and unwieldy in the code, so i also merged all the files and extracted them into a csv. This data has then been used in three different models: an XGBoost model, an NGBoost model and a Bayesian Neural Network. By building on the promising results from the XGBoost, it is hoped that using the confidence interval aspect of NGBoost the model can provide a useful predictive range when tested on experimental data.
